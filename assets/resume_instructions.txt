RESUME DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

Your portfolio is configured to download a resume file from:
d:\Portfolio\assets\Pradhap_Resume.pdf

TO ADD YOUR RESUME:
-------------------
1. Create or export your resume as a PDF file
2. Name it "Pradhap_Resume.pdf" (or update index.html line 99 to match your filename)
3. Place it in this folder: d:\Portfolio\assets\
4. Test the download button on your portfolio

The download button will work once you place your PDF file here!

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
-------------------
For now, I've created this text file. You should replace it with your actual resume PDF.

You can use:
- Microsoft Word -> Save As -> PDF
- Google Docs -> Download -> PDF
- Canva resume templates
- Any resume builder tool that exports to PDF
